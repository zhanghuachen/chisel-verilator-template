# CHISEL-VERILATOR-TEMPLATE

## OVERVIEW
This simple template is suitable for circuit designs that are written in chisel and simulated using Verilator. In this template, i use mill to build the Chisel project. 

## RUN THE PROJECT
`make run`

After executing `make run`, you will find Verilog/SystemVerilog files generated by Chisel in the "generated" directory, relevant files generated by Verilator in the "build" directory, and a waveform file named "dump.vcd" generated in the main folder. You can use these to verify the correctness of your code. Additionally, you can write ScalaTest files in the "test/scala" directory to validate correctness. Finally, you can implement other functionalities by modifying the `Makefile` and `build.sc` files as needed.
